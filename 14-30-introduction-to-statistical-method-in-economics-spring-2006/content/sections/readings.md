This section includes assigned readings from the three main texts used in the course.

Required Text
-------------

\[ROS\]: Ross, Sheldon M. _Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists_. 3rd ed. San Diego, CA: Academic Press, 2004. ISBN: 0125980574.

Recommended Texts
-----------------

\[LM\]: Larsen, Richard J., and Morris L. Marx. _An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and its Applications_. 3rd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2001. ISBN: 0139223037.

\[DS\]: DeGroot, Morris H., and Mark J. Schervish. _Probability and Statistics_. 3rd ed. Boston, MA: Addison-Wesley, 2002.

Larsen and Marx's book is a bit more chatty than Ross', while DeGroot and Schervish's is a very good book but somewhat more difficult. You can find additional resources in the [related resources]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/related-resources) section.

Assigned Readings
-----------------

Readings are from Ross \[ROS\], Larsen and Marx \[LM\], and DeGroot and Schervish \[DS\]. Note that ROS does not cover all the topics but more closely follows the material taught in class.
